A much smaller version of Workals.com, with a focus on search and tagging.
Workals' aim is to help software developers (particularly early-career ones) to manage their careers better. This can be achieved with the help of companies who are looking to improve their employer brand, and mentors.
Companies can:

- create a profile, add their information, add their engineering practices, and their hiring practices, as well as Mentors (software developers who are already working for them and who can decide when they are available to communicate with the wider industry).
Users can:  

- create a profile, choose whether to be mentors or mentees, set goals, and set their availability and visibility.
